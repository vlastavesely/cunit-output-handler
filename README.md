Colorful output handler for CUnit
=================================

This is a custom minimal output handler for `CUnit` framework that mimics
output of the Nette Tester. For every test, it shows a dot if test has
passed or a red letter `F` on failure. After all tests have been run, it
prints a minimal statistics.

but do not expect any support whatsoever.
